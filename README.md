This is a program that creates a **Library Management System** in **MySQL**. The program starts by creating a MySQL connection, The code then checks if the database **"library"** exists and creates it if it doesn't. Next, the code connects to the "library" database and creates three tables: **"books"**, **"issue"**, and **"submit"**.  
The main program consists of functions for adding new books, issuing books, submitting books, and deleting entries. The functions connect to the "library" database and use the cursor object to execute SQL statements to interact with the tables.
