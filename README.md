#This is a program that creates a library management system in MySQL. The program starts by creating a MySQL connection, creating the database "library", and creating tables "books", "issue", and "submit". The main program consists of functions for adding new books, issuing books, submitting books, and deleting entries. The functions connect to the "library" database and use the cursor object to execute SQL statements to interact with the tables.
